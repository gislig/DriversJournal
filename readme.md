# What is DriversJournal ?
In Iceland emloyees can get car subsidy from the employeer, now to get lower tax from the subsidy the emloyee needs to keep track of the km/miles that he drives while he uses the car in work. Now this has been done by paper in most cases and can be very frustrating to keep track on all of the papers. So I decided to make an application that everyone can access or use as a showcase for demo-ing Azure, while doing lectures, online videos or blog articles.
